      <div class="about">

        <div class="pg2">
        <p>I am passionate about coding apps and games. I’ve been passionate about this since I was a freshman and was first introduced to coding through school and the Minority Engineering Program of Indianapolis (MEPI). Since, I have learned four coding languages and have improved my use of them through internship experiences and projects. These three languages are Java, XML, Visual Basic and Microsoft PowerApps. Last summer (2021), I was selected for an IT internship at Eli Lilly and Company, one of the nation’s largest pharmaceutical companies. I used Microsoft PowerApps and other coding technology to build the user interface for three programs for use by internal managers at Lilly to hire college interns. This was a rewarding experience that involved several hours of implementation and execution by the Lilly personnel supervising my project.

          <br>
I also recently put my coding knowledge to work in a community service internship and project for a statewide non-profit called Bosma Enterprises that serves people who are blind or visually impaired. During this experience, I utilized Java to create an accessible technology application on Android for people who are blind to access to play games, which also involved voice over and audible technology. I am currently working to perfect the tool, which will be released by July 1, 2022. This non-paid internship (January 3-14) involved over 100 hours of community service during my school’s J-Term and a discovery, planning, and testing process. </p>
