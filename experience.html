        <p>My experience on the Mayor's Youth Leadership Council was great! I met some great people who wanted the same thing I wanted , which was for the youth of Indianapolis to have a say in what happens in their city. I believe that we as a group impacted Indianapolis greatly with the different projects we had created and I cannot wait to join next year!</p>

It also always serves as a reminder that I was born into very fourtunate circumstances that a lot of other black people do not have. It pushes to do more because I started out with more.</p>

        <p>XML is a markup language, like HTML, that has to do with displaying code. HTML and XML are different because HTML displays data and focuses on how it looks, while XML describes data and focuses on what the data is. I learned this language during an <a href=#bosma>IT Internship with Bosma</a> and it served as an intro to markup languages.</p>

The first game i played was Madden 2008, the first handheld console I owned was a Nintendo 3DS, the first official console I owned was a Nintendo Wii. All of these moments are dear to me because they remind me of a time when I had no real priorities and video games gave me a goal to shoot for.</p>
